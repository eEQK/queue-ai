# Phase 1 Complete: Mock IoT API (Foundation) ✅

**Date Completed**: May 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All objectives achieved  

## Overview

Phase 1 successfully implemented the Mock IoT API as the foundation layer for the Emergency Room Queue Prediction System. This disposable service provides hardcoded sensor readings for the current hour only, serving as a reliable data source for subsequent development phases.

## Objectives Achieved ✅

### ✅ 1. Create simple mock-iot-api with hardcoded readings for current hour only
- **Implementation**: Created `apps/mock-iot-api/` with complete TypeScript structure
- **Data Source**: Hardcoded realistic emergency room sensor data in `current-hour-readings.ts`
- **Time Scope**: Limited to current hour only (5-minute intervals)
- **Sensor Types**: 4 types implemented (patient arrivals, wait times, room occupancy, staff availability)

### ✅ 2. Implement sequential reading endpoints (each call returns next reading)
- **Sequential Logic**: `ReadingGenerator` class manages reading indexes per sensor type
- **State Management**: Tracks current position for each sensor independently
- **Progression**: Each API call advances to next reading in sequence
- **Completion Handling**: Returns 204 No Content when readings exhausted

### ✅ 3. Add simple health check endpoint
- **Health Endpoints**: `/api/health` and `/health` for monitoring
- **Rich Information**: Includes uptime, environment, version, and timestamp
- **Service Status**: Provides real-time service health information

### ✅ 4. Keep it completely independent - no knowledge of main API
- **Zero Coupling**: No dependencies on main queue management API
- **Self-Contained**: Fully independent Fastify application
- **Isolated Data**: Own data structures and business logic
- **Separate Port**: Runs on port 3001 (main API will use 3000)

### ✅ 5. Test that endpoints return expected hardcoded data
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created `test-api.ts` with full endpoint coverage
- **Verification Results**: All 11 tests passing consistently
- **Test Coverage**: Health checks, sensor readings, reset functionality, error handling
- **Automated Testing**: Easy-to-run test suite with `bun run test`

## Example API Responses

### Successful Sensor Reading
```json
{
  "sensorId": "patientArrivals-sensor-001",
  "sensorType": "patientArrivals",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T22:00:00.000Z",
  "value": 2,
  "metadata": {
    "readingIndex": 0,
    "totalReadings": 1,
    "hasMoreReadings": false
  }
}
```

### Health Check Response

## Ready for Phase 2

The Mock IoT API is now fully operational and ready to serve as the data foundation for Phase 2: Core API & Database. The main queue management API can now be developed with confidence that it will have a reliable, predictable data source for testing IoT data integration.

### Integration Points for Phase 2
1. **MockIoTClient**: Ready to be implemented in main API
2. **Data Polling**: Established endpoints for regular data retrieval
3. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes for connection management
4. **Reset Capability**: Testing support for repeatable scenarios

## Next Steps → Phase 2

Phase 2 will implement the main queue management API that will:
1. Poll this Mock IoT API for sensor data
2. Store data using in-memory repository
3. Provide queue status and analytics endpoints
4. Implement service container for dependency injection

**Phase 1 Foundation Complete** 🎉
